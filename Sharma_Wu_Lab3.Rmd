```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
crimeData <- read.csv("crime_v2.csv")
summary(crimeData)
```


# Data Cleansing
As shown in the summary table, there are 6 NA's in every variable. 
After reviewing the data, we found that all NA's are in 6 rows, so we remove those rows as they do not provide any information.
```{r}
crimeData2 <- crimeData[complete.cases(crimeData),]
```

Variable 'prbconv' is incorrectly displayed as a text field. We convert it to numermic.
```{r}
crimeData2$prbconv2 <- as.numeric(crimeData2$prbconv)
summary(crimeData2$prbconv2)
```


# EDA
```{r}
hist(crimeData$crmrte)
```
