crime rate <- density (positive)
prbarr <- density (positive)
beta1 is scaled away from zero gainning statistical significance
true beta1 > estimated beta1



Omitted variable 1: education
crime rate <- education (negative)
	higher education => less likely to commit a crime
	educated understand the law better and respect it
prbarr <- education (negative)
	educated people are aware of rights => avoid being wrongfully arrested
	police less likely to believe an educated people commit a crime
	more educated people are more familiar with investigation method (leave less clues)
alpha1 < 0
positive bias
alpha1 (estiamted) = -2.1 = beta1 (true) + positive
true is even more negative

prbconv <- education (negative)
	have higher income => afford better lawyer => less likely to be convicted
alpha1 < 0
positive bias
alpha1 (estiamted) = -0.8 = beta1 (true) + positive
true is even more negative





Omitted variable 2: % of people using drug
crime rate <- drug use (positive)
prbarr <- drug use (positive)
	drug addict are easier to be found if they committed a crime => higher arrest
	Higher chance police believes drug addicts committed a crime => higher arrest
	Drug addicts are in groups. Police can earily arrest the entire group when they find one.
alpha1 < 0
positive bias
alpha1 (estiamted) = -2.1 = beta1 (true) + positive
true is even more negative

prbconv <- drug use (positive)
	poor => cannot afford private lawyer => higher conviction
alpha1 < 0
positive bias
alpha1 (estiamted) = -0.8 = beta1 (true) + positive
true is even more negative




Omitted variable 3: age






Omitted variable 4: % of people are married with kids
crime rate <- % of people are married with kids (negative)
	married couples with kids have more considerations and thus less likely to commit a crime
prbarr <- % of people are married with kids (negative)
	afraid of retaliation => less likely to come forward with information
alpha1 < 0
positive bias
alpha1 (estiamted) = -2.1 = beta1 (true) + positive
true is even more negative

prbconv <- % of people are married with kids (negative)
	Judge will take into considerations of family conditions
alpha1 < 0
positive bias
alpha1 (estiamted) = -0.8 = beta1 (true) + positive
true is even more negative



Omitted variable 5: % of people who own guns
crime rate <- % of people who own guns (positive)
	fist fight => gun fight
prbarr <- % of people who own guns (positive)
	higher percentage of crime are shooting related. Guns are easier to be tracked.
alpha1 < 0
positive bias
alpha1 (estiamted) = -2.1 = beta1 (true) + positive
true is even more negative

prbconv <- % of people who own guns (negative)
	People with guns are richer => afford better lawyer => less likely to be convicted
alpha1 < 0
negative bias
alpha1 (estiamted) = -0.8 = beta1 (true) + negative
true is less negative than estimated
prbconv has less impact on the log of crime rate (lose statistical significance)





Omitted variable 6: % of immigrants 






Ommitted variable 7: % of smart mobile penetration
crime rate <- % of smart mobile penetration (positive)
	better communication via encrypted apps
	higher chance of theft on smart phones
prbarr <- % of smart mobile penetration (negative)
	better communication via encrypted apps
alpha1 < 0
negative bias
alpha1 (estiamted) = -2.1 = beta1 (true) + negative
true is less negative than estimated
prbarr has less impact on the log of crime rate (lose statistical significance)

prbconv <- % of smart mobile penetration (negative)
	smart phone has higher protection (such as iPhone), which are harder to crack by police
	not all policy are good at dealing with digital evidence
alpha1 < 0
negative bias
alpha1 (estiamted) = -0.8 = beta1 (true) + negative
true is less negative than estimated
prbconv has less impact on the log of crime rate (lose statistical significance)

















Questions:
What are top-coded variables?
"What covariates help you identify a causal effect?" How can we tell whether an effect is causal?
"you should not include outcome variables that will absorb some of the causal effect you are interested in" What does this mean?
